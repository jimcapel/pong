# pong

pong written in c++

# compiling

you will need to add the headers and libs for SDL2 / SDL2_image / SDL2_mixer (may also need to include zlib.dll to the root folder).

My file stucture as below (I chose to symlink the various SDL2 libraries and include them with a makefile):

# running

I have also included a compiled version of the game (pong.exe), if you wish to skip the compilation process.

# upcoming features

I would like to add a start/options menu to explore state management in the context of a game along with a basic AI to add a singleplayer experience.
